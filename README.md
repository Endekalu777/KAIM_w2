## Installation
### Creating a Virtual Environment
### Using Conda
If you prefer Conda as your package manager:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to your project directory.

3. Run the following command to create a new Conda environment:

```bash
conda create --name your_env_name python=3.12
```
- Replace your_env_name with the desired name for your environment e.g. week0 and 3.12 with your preferred Python version.
4. Activate the environment:

```bash
conda activate your_env_name
```
### Using Virtualenv
If you prefer using venv, Python's built-in virtual environment module:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to your project directory.

3. Run the following command to create a new virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv your_env_name
```
- Replace your_env_name with the desired name for your environment.

4. Activate the environment:

- On Windows:
```bash
.\your_env_name\scripts\activate
```
- On macOS/Linux:
```bash
source your_env_name/bin/activate
```

Now, your virtual environment is created and activated. You can install packages and run your Python scripts within this isolated environment. Don't forget to install required packages using pip or conda once the environment is activated.

To run this project locally, you will need Python installed on your system along with the necessary libraries. 
You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Clone this package
